# operating-system
This project implements a Multilevel Queue (MLQ) scheduling algorithm for an operating system. The system consists of two queues, Q1 and Q2, each with specific assigned priorities.
The Multilevel Queue (MLQ) scheduling algorithm implemented in this project aims to efficiently manage processes with varying priorities. It includes two queues, Q1 and Q2, where Q1 has a higher priority than Q2. The scheduling algorithm employs Round-Robin (RR) scheduling for processes in Q1 and Shortest-Job-First (SJF) scheduling for processes in Q2.

## How to run
1- clone the repository:

2- Run the program:
java Main

3- Follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of processes and their attributes.

4- Choose the desired menu option to view scheduling details and criteria.
